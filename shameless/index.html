  <h1>Shameless</h1>
  <h2>About the show</h2>
  <p>
    Shameless (USA version) is a comedy-drama series that features a poor, chaotic family living in the South Side of Chicago, Illinois. The family consists of:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frank Gallagher:</strong> The father of 6 children, who is mostly absent both physically and emotionally from his family. Frank is an alcoholic and concerns himself with his own wellbeing over his own children, which results in his children's resentment toward him.</li>
      <li><strong>Fiona Gallagher:</strong> The oldest of the Gallagher kids, Fiona assumes a &ldquo;motherly&rdquo; role for her younger siblings due to her mom and dad's absence. She is very hardworking and sacrifices much of her free time in order to take care of her siblings. She is also assertive and knows what she deserves, making her a very entertaining and likeable character.</li>
      <li><strong>Lip Gallagher:</strong> Another Gallagher sibling. Lip is very intelligent but also gets himself into trouble. Like his father, Lip picks up a dependency on alcohol. But unlike Frank, Lip seeks help because he genuinely wants to get better for himself and the people around him. </li>
      <li><strong>Ian Gallagher:</strong> The next Gallagher sibling. Ian's main storylines have to do with him navigating the world while being gay and having bipolar disorder. Ian and Mickey Milkovich (a violent neighbor often getting in trouble with the police) are together for most of the show, and although they are a chaotic pair, they are a fan favorite. </li>
      <li><strong>Debbie Gallagher:</strong> Yet another Gallagher sibling. Debbie sticks up for herself and is assertive like Fiona. When she is older, she works at a welding job that consists of mostly only men and manages to raise a child by herself simultaneously.</li>
      <li><strong>Carl Gallagher:</strong> Geez, another one? Since he was young, Carl has been a troubled child, involved in deviant and illegal behavior. At one point he sells drugs and ends up in juvie, but then eventually he enrolls in military school and turns his life around.</li>
      <li><strong>Liam Gallagher:</strong> The last one, I promise! Liam is the baby of the family and does not have character development until about the middle of the show. Later in the show, Liam ends up being very intelligent and funny. He is often involved with Frank's schemes to get money.</li>
      <li><strong>Veronica &ldquo;V&rdquo; and Kevin:</strong> The nieghbors of the Gallaghers. V is Fiona's best friend who Fiona often confides in. V and Kevin run a bar where Frank is often at. The couple is very humorous and extremely likeable.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Why I love the show</h2>
  <p>
    This show might be my absolute favorite show. Not only is it super funny, but it is realistic, which allows to viewer to appreciate it even more. I love how Shameless is both comedic and serious, because it addresses important issues in real life while also leaving the viewer feeling good after watching it. The overall chaos of the Gallagher family is a great show to watch if you want to take your mind off of your own life for a second. Additionally, the character development is fantastic in the way that every character has their own storylines and no one character is more important than the other.
