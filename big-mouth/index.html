  <h1>Big Mouth</h1>
  <h2>About the show</h2>
  <p>
    Big Mouth is an animated sitcom about 3 middle schoolers -Nick, Jessi, and Andrew- who are starting puberty. The three friends navigate what it means to grow into teenagers and how to navigate the cultural scripts that come with becoming a woman or man. Each middle schooler is assigned a &ldquo;Hormone Monster/Monstress&rdquo;, which is a personification of the changing hormones each child is enduring. The two favorite hormone monsters and monstresses are Connie and Maury, who add an essential part of the humor to the show.

  <h2>Why I love the show</h2>
  <p>
    I love this show so much because it is simultaneously ridiculous and hilarious, but also genuinely educational and even serious at times. I love how candid the topics are; they don't shy away from anything, regardless of how controversial or taboo the topic may be seen as. For instance, one of the episodes from the new season (Season 3) discusses the conflict with toxic masculinity/misogyny in America and how there is a culture of punishing girls for wearing certain clothing rather than teaching boys that girls are deserving of respect regardless of what they wear. This topic is addressed in a very humorous way while also being very serious and informative, which makes it extremely enjoyable.
