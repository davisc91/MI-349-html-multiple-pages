  <h1>Euphoria</h1>
  <h2>About the show</h2>
  <p>
    Euphoria is an American drama series about a high schooler named Rue who battles drug addiction. Among Rue are:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Jules:</strong> a highly expressive and impulsive transgender girl with whom Rue begins to fall in love</li>
      <li><strong>Nate:</strong> an extraordinarily angry and violent high school football player who loathes his dad for being gay, and is struggling with his own sexuality</li>
      <li><strong>Maddy:</strong> a self-assured and audacious cheerleader who has a tumultous relationship with Nate</li>
      <li><strong>Cassie:</strong> a misunderstood girl who battles with others&rsquo; perception of her due to her sexual past</li>
      <li><strong>Kat:</strong> an initially timid girl with body insecurities who is learning to become confident in herself</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Why I love the show</h2>
  <p>
    This show is riveting, to say the least. Beyond the cinematography being indescribably gorgeous, I love how the show delves into the backstory of every character in order to give the viewer a good idea of why the individual is the way that they are. The acting is exceptional and makes each character extremely realistic and believable, like they could represent real people, and makes you very attached to each character. The chaotic storylines rope you in and leave you always wanting more. What I love most about Euphoria is the numerous conflicts that are happening simultaneously, and the diversity of issues that each character has. Though this show only has one season (just renewed for a second!), there has never been a more effortless addition to my list of favorite television shows.
